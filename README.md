# 738_Project_1
First Project for Machine Learning Class (EECS 738)

## Algorithms used
I used the algorithm K-Means for this project

## Datasets Used
- [Mushroom Poisonous Dataset]{https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification}
- [Car MPG Dataset]{https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/autompg-dataset}

## Implementation
- K-Means 

Requirements:

• Properly Labeled Data

• Noise-Free Data

• Preferably Small Number of Classes Dataset

How does it work?

• K-Means is an unsupervised learning model that takes how many clusters to use for classification

More discussion and evaluation of my implementation is in the kmeans.ipynb
